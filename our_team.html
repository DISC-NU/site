									<blockquote>Last year, I felt lost in the field of computer science because I couldn't se the positive impacts of what I would be doing after college. I hope to foster an environment in CS + Social Good where other students can realize the possible social implications of technology work, and to offer our members a chance to work on such projects while they are still completing their studies.</blockquote>
